# This program allows a user to enter a nonnegative
# integer and then uses a loop to calculate the 
# factorial of that number. 

# Ask the user to enter a positive integer.
entered_integer = int(input("Please enter a positive number: "))

# Defining the factorial.
factorial = 1

# Establishing the range of the positive integer entered and
# the mathematical operator to link integer with factorial.
for positive_integer in range( 1, entered_integer + 1 ):
    factorial = positive_integer * factorial

# Print function to give the appropriate factorial output.
